As a member of Mu Alpha Theta, you are expected to attend the club's meetings and compete in the AMC and Log(1) competitions as well as maintain your participation in math extracurriculars (especially if you put them on your application!). Full members are also required to maintain the minimum math GPA requirement on the application.

Absences from more than 3 meetings (including Log(1) test dates) will result in loss of membership. Taking the AMC is mandatory for all members.
