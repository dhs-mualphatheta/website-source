# How to Join

There is no application process for the math team, anyone is welcome!  Simply come to room B111 after school on Wednesday to get started.  
Keep in mind that the first Wednesday of every month is a competition, so no practice will be held on these days and the team will meet in the math learning connections room before boarding the bus.
