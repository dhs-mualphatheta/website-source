# About Us
We meet Monday mornings at 7:10 in A101

We compete in various math modeling competitions throughout the year.  
These competitions are optional, but you are encouraged to join the club with the intention of competing in at least one of these competitions during the year. 

Our meetings generally consist of learning basic skills relevant to math modeling.
